                   Teaching young people to code early on can help

                It is a strong tool that helps to get ahead in life. For being motivated we need a driving tool or goal that keeps us motivated and moves forward. Also, it helps in being progressive both physically and mentally.

Moreover, your goal does not be to big and long term they can be small and empowering. Furthermore, you need the right mindset to be motivated.

                A teacher has a major contribution in making the future of a child. From play group to graduation, I have changed many Schools and Colleges and thus it is obvious that I have encountered with different types of teachers. Some of them were very friendly and some were very strict, some only scolded us on our mistakes whereas some punished us severely.

                     Books are those things whom the scholar understands the treasure of knowledge.

                <p >Books are our faithfull and best friends. Books are like a sea and these are fulfilled with
                    concepts, thoughts and new ideas. Literature is the mirror of society, culture and visualise civilization.
                    Books have the solutions to every problem and are the best friends who will never leave anyone. Reading books from various genres helps us think and analyse in various ways.
                    It is no news that books are a great source of entertainment as there are many kinds of readers, who are a fan of books like novels, poetry books, short stories, magazines, comics, etc. Sometimes reading also becomes an addiction, but in my opinion, it is a good kind of addiction that will only be beneficial for an individual.
